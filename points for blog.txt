- Talk about the need for time series
- Difference between intapolation(regular regression) and extrapolation(time series)

Time series general procedure(ARIMA):
- Visualize time series data
- Make time series data stationary
- Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
- Construct ARIMA model based on data
- Use the model to make predictions



IMPROVEMENTS:
- add residuals for the arima and auto arima
- Add metrics analysis to project.
- use plotly for interactive plots.


Why are all the focast vals the same?
Sort out the arima model preditions later.
 - Regress to the mean.
 - too few data points.
